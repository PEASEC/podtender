# Podtender
An async rust client library for the [Podman REST API](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/Reference.html).

## Usage

### Example
```rust
use tokio;
use podtender::podman_service::PodmanService;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
  let podman_service = PodmanService::new("path/to/podman/socket");
  let podtender_result = podman_service.system().get_info().await.unwrap();
  println!("{podtender_result:?}");
}
```
The [integration tests](https://github.com/PEASEC/podtender/tree/main/tests) also act as examples for how to use the crate.

### Podman setup
The [Podman service](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-system-service.1.html) needs to be set up before the crate can be used. 
```shell
# Set up podman service
podman system service unix:///home/`whoami`/podman.sock --log-level=debug --time=50
# Test if the socket is up and running
curl --unix-socket /home/`whoami`/podman.sock http://d/v4.0.0/libpod/info
```
### Supported Podman version
We aim to support the latest Podman version only. Currently, this is 4.1.x.

### Crate features
#### Builder pattern via derive builder
The `builder` feature enables the builder pattern for request types. This is implemented with the [builder derive macro](https://github.com/colin-kiegel/rust-derive-builder).
IDE support for code created by macros may be limited.
```rust
// with builder feature
let create_volume_parameter = CreateVolumeParameterBuilder::default()
    .driver("local".to_owned())
    .volume_name("some_volume_name".to_owned())
    .options(some_previously_created_hashmap)
    .build()
    .expect("Error building CreateVolumeParameter");
// without builder feature
let create_volume_parameter = CreateVolumeParameter {
    driver: Some("local".to_owned()),
    labels: None,
    volume_name: Some("some_volume_name".to_owned())
    options: Some(some_previously_created_hashmap),
}
```

#### Example parameters used in tests
The `examples` feature enables initialized parameters via the `ExampleValues` trait. This is mostly intended for tests and
to showcase a usable example parameter per API operation.

#### Tracing
`enable-tracing` enables logs/tracing powered by [Tokio's tracing crate](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing).

### Requirements
Podtender uses [hyper](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper) and requires [tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio).
An active Podman socket is needed to communicate with Podman.

### Project structure
The Podman socket and network operations are internally managed by the `PodmanService` struct.

The [Podman API](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/_static/api.html?version=v4.0) categorizes endpoints into multiple sections. This crate is based on that structure.
The [pods](src/pods) module contains all api call functions, parameter types and response types for the implemented
[pods](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/_static/api.html?version=v4.0#tag/pods) API endpoints.

Every endpoint category module contains:
* the parameter types, used to configure the request
* the api call functions used to make the request 
* the response types into which the response gets deserialized

To start a pod, you would configure `podtender::pods::parameter_types::PodStatsParameter`
use it with `podman_service.pods().start(parameter).await` and expect `podtender::pods::response_types::StartPodResponse`.


## Notes
* Only unix socket is currently supported
* Podtender currently only builds on Linux since tokio only builds support for unix sockets on Linux 
* Podman (API) is treated as trusted and in testing as source of truth
* To create a container in bridge network mode, use this as starting point:
  ```
  CreateContainerParameter {
        netns: Some(Namespace {
            nsmode: Some("bridge".to_owned()),
            value: None,
        }),
        ..Default::default()
    };
  ```
* The following error indicates the Podman socket not being available. If this happens in tests, rerunning recreates the socket for the defined ttl and should get rid of the error.
  ```
   HyperError(
       hyper::Error(
           Connect,
           Os {
               code: 2,
               kind: NotFound,
               message: "No such file or directory",
           },
       ),
   )
   ```
* The `connect_container_to_network_from_example` test require the `192.168.123.0/24` subnet to be unused on the machine executing the tests. 
* `2021-05-26T10:42:00+02:00` timestamps are supported by Podman, this crate currently only supports dates as strings.
* Podman only supports query array in this format: `containers=container1&containers=container2`
* Tests create the Podman service socket at `unix:///home/{user}/{socket_name}.sock`, the `socket_name` can be changed in [tests/utils](tests/utils/mod.rs).
* Tests build images from the Dockerfiles in [test_container](https://github.com/PEASEC/podtender/tree/main/test_container).
